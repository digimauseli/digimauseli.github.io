While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=base-psycho-by-yaybases-on-deviantart>Base Psycho By YayBases On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#base-psycho-by-yaybases-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://pre05.deviantart.net/0b18/th/pre/f/2017/223/e/e/untitled_drawing_by_1char11-dbjn6oa.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.PmVIsSm6kjGGb_ljQcnGXwHaF_&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Base Psycho by YayBases on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>psycho.</p></blockquote><ol start=5><li></li></ol><h2 id=psychotic-base-by-h-e-a-r-t-l-e-s-s-on-deviantart>Psychotic Base By H-E-A-R-T-L-E-S-S On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#psychotic-base-by-h-e-a-r-t-l-e-s-s-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/e2eac234-c2c6-4b5f-8696-442de78083a9/d4xiiaz-4878fa90-9181-4ecc-a03f-fee65d1420df.png/v1/fill/w_600,h_900,q_80,strp/psychotic_base_by_h_e_a_r_t_l_e_s_s_d4xiiaz-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOiIsImlzcyI6InVybjphcHA6Iiwib2JqIjpbW3siaGVpZ2h0IjoiPD05MDAiLCJwYXRoIjoiXC9mXC9lMmVhYzIzNC1jMmM2LTRiNWYtODY5Ni00NDJkZTc4MDgzYTlcL2Q0eGlpYXotNDg3OGZhOTAtOTE4MS00ZWNjLWEwM2YtZmVlNjVkMTQyMGRmLnBuZyIsIndpZHRoIjoiPD02MDAifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.ZCK9f3SR7QqddeGmc1n0NyUYq_DJlk8bDRzkY2MIZew" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.OYmvIskS0HFiay7NN-hLigHaLH&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Psychotic Base by H-E-A-R-T-L-E-S-S on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>psychotic.</p></blockquote><p>Wallpapers are a type of image that is downloaded as a background image on some devices.
