While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=how-to-draw-cartoons-eye-drawing>How To Draw Cartoons: Eye Drawing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#how-to-draw-cartoons-eye-drawing>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://3.bp.blogspot.com/__GBb4kNtPC8/S6zAQ5jd9YI/AAAAAAAAArA/eQGOYKXM--Y/s1600/eye-4.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.38F28jH36fTTTMLZ71-iFAHaFi&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="How To Draw Cartoons: Eye Drawing"><p><em>Source: draw-cartoons.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>eye drawing draw simple cartoons cartoon step instructions clipartmag hope enjoy these.</p></blockquote><p>Types of Anime: Animation, Comedy, Drama, Fantasy, Sports, and more
